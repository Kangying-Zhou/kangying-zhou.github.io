<!-- ## About             -->

I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Finance at Yale School of Management. I conduct research on asset pricing, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Before Yale, I earned an M.S. in Financial Mathematics from the University of Chicago and a B.S. in Economics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market. 



## Job Market Paper      

### [*Active Mutual Funds and Media Narratives*]()

*Abstract*: I investigate the impact of media narratives on the portfolio strategies of active equity mutual funds. Using 1.5 million *Wall Street Journal* articles from 1984 to 2023, I use ChatGPT to distill business news into 59 distinct topics, and quantify the time-varying attention and sentiment associated with each one. I find that the topics that fund managers choose to have high exposure to are those with high sentiment, but not necessarily those with high attention. While this strategy leads to underperformance, it nonetheless attracts investor flows, which explains its use. Tilting toward different topics explains a substantial part of the variation in the aggregate mutual fund active tilt, and is a key driver of the negative alpha associated with active tilt.

with Bryan Kelly and Semyon Malamud  
[*The Journal of Finance 79, no. 1 (2024): 459-503.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.13298)      

*Abstract*: Much of the extant literature predicts market returns with “simple” models that use only a few parameters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we theoretically prove that simple models severely understate return predictability compared to “complex” models in which the number of parameters *exceeds* the number of observations. We empirically document the virtue of complexity in US equity market return prediction. Our findings establish the rationale for modeling expected returns through machine learning.

## Working Paper     
### [*The Virtue of Complexity Everywhere*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4166368)
with Bryan Kelly and Semyon Malamud     

*Abstract*: We investigate the performance of non-linear return prediction models in the high complexity regime, i.e., when the number of model parameters exceeds the number of observations. We document a "virtue of complexity" in all asset classes that we study (US equities, international equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, and interest rates). Specifically, return prediction R-squared and optimal portfolio Sharpe ratio generally increase with model parameterization for every asset class. The virtue of complexity is present even in extremely data-scarce environments, e.g., for predictive models with less than twenty observations and tens of thousands of predictors. The empirical association between model complexity and out-of-sample model performance exhibits a striking consistency with theoretical predictions.

### [*Robust Prediction after Structural Breaks*]()      
<!-- Solo-authored -->

*Abstract*: I propose a new modeling approach for time series prediction after structural breaks. The method incorporates a time trend variable into non-linear predictive models to effectively handle coefficient variations over time. By optimizing the bias-variance tradeoff, this approach significantly improves prediction accuracy and optimal portfolio Sharpe ratio compared to both linear and non-linear standard models. I construct Monte Carlo simulations to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures. Empirically, the paper demonstrates improved prediction performance for U.S. equity market returns. These findings establish the robustness of machine learning predictions in the presence of structural breaks.
